# StopSpot
StopSpot is a project to focuse on the quality assurance of static transit stop gps coordinates. These static coordinates will be checked against the dynamic stop data coordinates of transit vehicle. What we are looking for in the data is how far of a distance between when the vehicle stop and where the actual transit stop. Once we have analyze the data, C-Tran will take a look at our findings to determine if our analysis are valid. If the analysis are valid then they will come up with a plan and take actions that can help traffic congestions and provide a better service to customers.
